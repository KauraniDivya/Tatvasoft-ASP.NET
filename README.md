Sure, I'll include the necessary packages that are commonly used in an ASP.NET Core application with Entity Framework Core. Here's an updated version of your `README.md`:

```markdown
# WebApplication3

This repository contains an ASP.NET Core application that uses Entity Framework Core for database operations. Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed .NET Core SDK.
- You have installed an IDE such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
- You have a local or remote SQL Server instance available.

## Packages Used

The following NuGet packages are used in this project:
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`

These packages are included in the project file (`.csproj`), and they will be restored when you run `dotnet restore`.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/WebApplication3.git
cd WebApplication3
```

### Configure the Connection String

Open the `appsettings.json` file and add your SQL Server connection string in the `ConnectionStrings` section. It should look something like this:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server;Database=your_database;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;PORT=5432"
  },
 
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```
Replace `5432` with the port number your application (Postgresql) is running on.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and restore the necessary packages by running:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### Create the Initial Migration

Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio or use the terminal, and run the following command to create an initial migration:

```bash
Add-Migration InitialDatabase
```

This will scaffold a migration to create the initial set of tables for your database based on your model.

### Apply the Migration to the Database

Once the migration is created successfully, apply it to your database by running:

```bash
Update-Database
```

This command will apply the migration and create the database schema.


### Perform Operations

You can now perform CRUD operations through the controllers. The data will be persisted to your configured database.

### Example: Accessing the Controller

Assuming you have a `BooksController`, you can access it via:

```
https://localhost:5432/api/books
```

Replace `5432` with the port number your application (Postgresql) is running on.
